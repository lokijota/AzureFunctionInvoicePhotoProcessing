TO-DO:
- Call cognitive services to do OCR (form recognizer/computer vision?)
- rotate image if upside down or sideways
- error handling in case it's not an image
- repro the setup (why does funcions.json only have 1 binding?)
- put minimum sizes in configuration & others as applicable
- remove source file after processing
- dynamically specify the name of the output file

- if saving a JPEG and the source was not JPEG, there will be a problem, the contents of the file won't match the extension => rename

- Make the output width variable > based on a configuration
- Make the output width variable > based on legibility
- Extract the date from the JPEG metadata and use that in the output filename
- When I deploy, carry along the AppInsights configuration instead of doing it in the Azure Portal
